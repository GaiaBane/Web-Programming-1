<p id = "chardescription">Anderson is a 25-year-old man from Navia. At first glance, he just seems like an impeccably clad, spoiled socialite, but he’s knowledgeable in a vast number of subjects, especially the sciences. He’s the only child, so spent a lot of time hanging out with the main character while residing in their hometown, Navia. He’s very close to his uncle, Byron, because he was a very influential and positive male role model for Anderson growing up.</p>
