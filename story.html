<p id = "storytext1">There’s a murder that happened in the Grimsby’s house. The victim, the wife Sel.</p>
<br>
<p id = "storytext2">The household spoke fondly of Sel. Her husband doesn’t like speaking about her death, which naturally makes sense. Her room has also been untouched for years. No one really knows what happened to her, her body was never found. Anderson decides to visit his ill uncle, Byron, but he does not want to travel alone. He convinces the main character to travel to Galleon with him, promising that they’ll enjoy their time on the estate.</p>
<br>
<p id = "storytext3">The main character agrees, only because they get to paint a portrait of Byron Grimsby. They arrive at Galleon and they meet Byron at his estate. The estate looks pristine against the dark imposing forest, but the main character feels uneasy at first arrival. Everything seems normal at first, but things start to get weird when the MC finds Sel’s door opened one day.</p>
